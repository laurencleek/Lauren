 I am a PhD researcher at the Political Science department of the *European University Institute* in Florence, Italy, where I am a third year [**PhD researcher**](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=lauren-leek). I just came back from a year long exchange at the London School of Economics. I recently took half a year leave of absence from my PhD and worked as a **PhD trainee** at the *European Central Bank* in the Fiscal Policies division of DG Economics.


My interests:
------
My thesis working title is: Essays in Agenda-setting, Central Bank Communication and Formal Institutional Set-ups. More generally, I am interested in applied social science questions which can be answered with various quantitative methods and big data.

- Political Economy (inequality, central banking)
- Computational social science (text-as-data, machine learning, social data science)
- Political behaviour (mass-elite linkage)
- Quantitative methods (causal inference, surveys, timeseries)

My background:
------
I hold a BSc in **Liberal Arts and Sciences** with a major in Economics and a minor in Big Data from the [*Erasmus University College*](https://www.eur.nl/en/euc) in Rotterdam. I also hold a MSc in **Political Economy of Europe** from the [*London School of Economics*](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute). I have *teaching experience* in Microeconomics (BSc level) and Quantitative methods (PhD level) and have held several RA positions. I also have various teaching and board/committee experiences outside of academia.
