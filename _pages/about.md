I am currently a PhD trainee at the European Central Bank in the Fiscal Policies division of DG Economics. I am on a four month leave of absence from my PhD at the Political Science department of the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, where I am a second year PhD student.

My interests include:
------
- The politics of central banking
- European fiscal integration
- Computational social science, specifically text-as-data and machine learning
- Political behaviour

My background:
------
I hold a BSc in liberal arts and sciences with a major in Economics and a minor in Big Data from the Erasmus University College in Rotterdam. I also hold a MSc in Political Economy of Europe from the London School of Economics. I have teaching experience in Microeconomics (BSc level) and Quantatitative methods (PhD level) and have held several RA positions, besides various experiences outside of academia.
