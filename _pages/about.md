I am currently a visiting PhD researcher at the London School of Economics, European Institute and a [**PhD researcher**](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=lauren-leek) at the Political and Social Science department of the *European University Institute* in Florence, Italy . I just came back from a 6 months leave of absence from my PhD during which I was a **PhD trainee** at the *European Central Bank* in the Fiscal Policies division of DG Economics.

My interests:
------
My thesis working title is: Essays in Agenda-setting, Central Bank Communication and Formal Institutional Set-ups.More generally, I am interested in applied social and policy questions which can be answered with various quantitative methods. 

My interests broadly include:
- Political economy (central banking, taxation, climate, political systems)
- EU studies (fiscal European integration and democratic reforms)
- Computational social science (text-as-data, large language models, machine learning)
- Quantitative methods (causal inference, timeseries, data science)

My background:

I hold a BSc in **Liberal Arts and Sciences** with a major in Economics and a minor in Big Data from the [*Erasmus University College*](https://www.eur.nl/en/euc) in Rotterdam. I also hold a MSc in **Political Economy of Europe** from the [*London School of Economics*](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute). I have *teaching experience* in Microeconomics (BSc level) and Quantitative methods (PhD level) and have held several RA positions. I also have various teaching and board/committee experiences outside of academia.
