I am currently a **PhD trainee** at the *European Central Bank* in the Fiscal Policies division of DG Economics. I am on a four month leave of absence from my PhD at the Political Science department of the *European University Institute* in Florence, Italy, where I am a second year [**PhD researcher**](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=lauren-leek).

My interests include:
------
- The politics of central banking
- European fiscal integration (NGEU and monetary-fiscal interaction)
- Computational social science (text-as-data and machine learning)
- Political behaviour (mass-elite linkage)
- Quantitative methods (causal inference, surveys)

My background:
------
I hold a BSc in **Liberal Arts and Sciences** with a major in Economics and a minor in Big Data from the [*Erasmus University College*](https://www.eur.nl/en/euc) in Rotterdam. I also hold a MSc in **Political Economy of Europe** from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute). I have *teaching experience* in Microeconomics (BSc level) and Quantitative methods (PhD level) and have held several RA positions. I also have various teaching and board/committee experiences outside of academia.
